        YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. Three former PayPal
        employees—Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—created the service in February 2005. Google bought the site
        in
        November 2006 for US$1.65 billion; YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries.

        YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to playlists, report, comment on videos, and subscribe to
        other users. It offers a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos. Available content includes
        video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live
        streams, and other content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos. Most of the
        content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including CBS, the BBC, Vevo, and Hulu
        offer
        some of their material via YouTube as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can only watch
        videos on the site, while registered users are permitted to upload an unlimited number of videos and add
        comments
        to videos. Videos deemed potentially inappropriate are available only to registered users affirming themselves
        to
        be at least 18 years old.

        YouTube and its creators earn advertising revenue from Google AdSense, a program which targets ads according to
        site content and audience. The vast majority of its videos are free to view, but there are exceptions, including
        subscription-based premium channels, film rentals, as well as YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, subscription
        services respectively offering premium and ad-free music streaming, and ad-free access to all content ,
        including
        exclusive content commissioned from notable personalities. As of February 2017, there were more than 400 hours
        of
        content uploaded to YouTube each minute, and one billion hours of content being watched on YouTube every day. As
        of August 2018, the website is ranked as the second-most popular site in the world, according to Alexa
        Internet.[1]

        YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations, including its handling of copyrighted content
        contained within uploaded videos, its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy
        theories and falsehoods, hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent and/or sexually
        suggestive content involving popular characters, videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their
        comment sections, and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with
        advertising.

        Main article: History of YouTube

        From left to right: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim, the founders of YouTube
        YouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, who were all early employees of PayPal.[6]
        Hurley
        had studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together
        at
        the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.[7] According to a story that has often been repeated in the
        media,
        Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced
        difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did
        not
        attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded
        after
        a dinner party "was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very
        digestible".[8]

        Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson's role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident,
        when
        her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Karim could not
        easily find video clips of either event online, which led to the idea of a video sharing site.[9] Hurley and
        Chen
        said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service, and had been influenced
        by the website Hot or Not.[8][10] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the
        site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any type of video.[11]


        The YouTube logo from launch until 2011, featuring its former slogan Broadcast Yourself
        YouTube began as a venture capital-funded technology startup, primarily from an $11.5 million investment by
        Sequoia Capital and an $8 million investment from Artis Capital Management between November 2005 and April
        2006.[12][13] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and Japanese restaurant in San Mateo,
        California.[14] The domain name www.youtube.com was activated on February 14, 2005, and the website was
        developed
        over the subsequent months.[15] The first YouTube video, titled Me at the zoo, shows co-founder Jawed Karim at
        the
        San Diego Zoo.[16] The video was uploaded on April 23, 2005, and can still be viewed on the site.[17] YouTube
        offered the public a beta test of the site in May 2005. The first video to reach one million views was a Nike
        advertisement featuring Ronaldinho in November 2005.[18][19] Following a $3.5 million investment from Sequoia
        Capital in November, the site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8
        million views a day.[20][21] The site grew rapidly and, in July 2006, the company announced that more than
        65,000
        new videos were being uploaded every day, and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[22]
        According to data published by market research company comScore, YouTube is the dominant provider of online
        video
        in the United States, with a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos in May
        2010.[23]

        In May 2011, 48 hours of new videos were uploaded to the site every minute,[24] which increased to 60 hours
        every
        minute in January 2012,[24] 100 hours every minute in May 2013,[25][26] 300 hours every minute in November
        2014,[27] and 400 hours every minute in February 2017.[28] As of January 2012, the site had 800 million unique
        users a month.[29] It is estimated that in 2007 YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in
        2000.[30] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, YouTube is the second-most
        visited website in the world, as of December 2016; SimilarWeb also lists YouTube as the top TV and video website
        globally, attracting more than 15 billion visitors per month.[1][31][32] In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new
        office in San Bruno, California.[33]

        The choice of the name www.youtube.com led to problems for a similarly named website, www.utube.com. The site's
        owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being
        regularly
        overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube has since changed the name of its website to
        www.utubeonline.com.[34][35] On October 9, 2006, Google Inc. announced that it had acquired YouTube for $1.65
        billion in Google stock,[36][37] and the deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[38][39]


        YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California
        In March 2010, YouTube began free streaming of certain content, including 60 cricket matches of the Indian
        Premier
        League. According to YouTube, this was the first worldwide free online broadcast of a major sporting event.[40]
        On
        March 31, 2010, the YouTube website launched a new design, with the aim of simplifying the interface and
        increasing the time users spend on the site. Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented: "We really felt
        like we needed to step back and remove the clutter."[41] In May 2010, YouTube videos were watched more than two
        billion times per day.[42][43][44] This increased to three billion in May 2011,[45][46][47] and four billion in
        January 2012.[24][48] In February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube was watched every day.[49][50][51]

        In October 2010, Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as chief executive officer of YouTube to take
        an
        advisory role, and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company.[52] In April 2011, James Zern, a
        YouTube software engineer, revealed that 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[53] In November
        2011, the Google+ social networking site was integrated directly with YouTube and the Chrome web browser,
        allowing
        YouTube videos to be viewed from within the Google+ interface.[54]


        YouTube logo from 2015 until 2017
        In December 2011, YouTube launched a new version of the site interface, with the video channels displayed in a
        central column on the home page, similar to the news feeds of social networking sites.[55] At the same time, a
        new
        version of the YouTube logo was introduced with a darker shade of red, the first change in design since October
        2006.[56] In May 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium,
        subscription-based
        channels within the platform.[57][58] In February 2014, Susan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube.[59] In
        November 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as "Music Key", which bundled ad-free streaming of
        music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[60]

        In February 2015, YouTube released a secondary mobile app known as YouTube Kids. The app is designed to provide
        an
        experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels
        featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features.[61] Later on August 26, 2015, YouTube launched
        YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with
        the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[62]

        In October 2015, YouTube announced YouTube Red (now YouTube Premium), a new premium service that would offer
        ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year),
        premium original series and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content
        on
        mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the
        music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[63][64][65]

        In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million.
