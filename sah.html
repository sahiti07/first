    <p>A song is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be <em>Lorem ipsum dolor
        sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sint fugit consequatur maxime?</em> sung by the human voice with
      distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the
      repetition <strong>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Deleniti, suscipit incidunt?</strong>
      of sections. Through semantic widening, a broader <i>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.</i> sense of the word
      "song" may refer to instrumentals.[1][2][3]
      Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically <b>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
        consectetur adipisicing elit. Eveniet.</b> created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed
      music <marquee behavior="alternate" direction="left">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
      </marquee> in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours
      and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned <sup>Lorem ipsum dolor
        sit.</sup> informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who
      sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad
      appeal, are often composed by professional <sub>Lorem ipsum dolor sit.</sub> songwriters, composers and lyricists.
      Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed
      live and recorded <i>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</i> on audio or video (or, in some cases, a song may be performed
      live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and
      within operas. </p>click here for more info: <a href="iti.html">Lorem, ipsum.</a>
