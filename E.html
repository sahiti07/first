    <p style="color:teal"> Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time.
      General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and
      its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities
      of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of
      music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of
      instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely
      vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.

      <em>
        The word derives from Greek (mousike; "art of the Muses"). See glossary of musical terminology.</em> <br>
      In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation
      of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of
      music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones
      ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres"
      and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. <br><br>
      <strong>However,
        20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no noise,
        only
        sound.</strong> " <br>
      The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social
      context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music",
      including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825, early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and
      hardcore punk in the 1980s. There are many types of music, including popular music, traditional music, art
      music, music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys. Music ranges from strictly
      organized compositionsâ€“such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously
      played improvisational music such as jazz, and avant-garde styles of chance-based contemporary music from the 20th
      and 21st centuries. </p>
