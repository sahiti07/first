    <p style="background-color:lightblue"> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less travelled
      by, and that has made all the
      differences. This
      is
      an excerpt from the poem,"The Road Not Taken" by a great poet of all times - Robert Frost.

      It speaks about different choices we have, different decisions we take, different calculations we consider,
      different results we get. But it all starts at a starting point where the diversion starts. At this time,when the
      21
      <sup>st</sup> century is no more new, our young learners have exposure to a wide range of subjects.

      Advancement in our technology has certainly contributed to these choices.Gone are the days when 9 out of 10
      students
      had the same answers for the most popular(and obvious)question we come across child hood -'What do you want to
      become when you grow up?'.The trend of children want to become engineers or doctors slowly started dimnishing by
      the
      end of the 20<sup>th</sup>century.Even arts like painting,fine arts,dance starting to find a great place in the
      proffesional world.Games & sports,which we are finding to be 'aparthied'slowly started gaining momentum and
      celebrities started emerging from them. </p>
